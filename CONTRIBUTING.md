## Run locally

From the project root:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Visit the `localhost` page given. You will be prompted to login via Google.
The login account used must be allowed first.

## Update mappings

For now there's no user config via the UI, so update mappings manually by hand:

```bash
vi ./src/components/Upload.tsx
```
